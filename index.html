        <p>My name is Chris Jones. I enjoy playing video games with my family. I would like to create my own video games, so I wanted to learn how to code.
        Now, I am enjoying learning everything about coding and the bigger scope of what it can be used for, including web development.
        I am excited to keep learning all I can.</p>
