            My name is Chris Jones. I enjoy playing video games with my family. I would like to create my own video
            games, so I wanted to learn how to code.
            Now, I am enjoying learning everything about coding and the bigger scope of what it can be used for,
            including web development.
            I am excited to keep learning all I can.

            Virginia is home to many historic places, such as Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement.
            You can visit many natural park areas, and even spend time in the ocean at Virginia Beach.
            Virginia is also famous for peanuts. There are many fun places in Virginia, and many cool things you can
            learn.
